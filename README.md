# Attendance_taking_app

My own project on which i worked alone by taking help of different websites and peers.

This is the app for faster ,better and smart way for taking attendance specially for faculties in schools and collages. Swipe right if a student is present else swipe left.
Implemented Room-Database (for maintaining list of absent students) , MVVM architecture, Recyclerview with adapter, Swipe functionality (for marking absent-present).
Also implemented Calendar View with the current date and month showing on. 
Applied eye attracting UI with my college (RIT) logo.
